## Project 2

Biggest takeaway from Project 2 is how important it is think about any refactoring undertaking. I lost a lot of momentum when I first started because I didn't look at how my page structure would need to change for the chaoter slide animation. I had to go back to square one multiple times because my changes need to have more elements for me to manipulate. Once I backed up and pulled my logic apart I saw that I could modularize my code as well to make it better altogether.

I also learned that I can make CSS work for me (but I really only want to when it's managed by JS to keep my sanity intact because the JS fun overshadows the nightmares of CSS).

## Project 1

I think I've started to buy into the fact that Javascript can do more than just alter a website's DOM structure. However, I don't know if I'm converted to doing a single page app without using a framework. (Not that this was the purpose of the assignment, but that's what we built out.)

I also realized how much work event listeners can handle. It's kind of like lifecycle methods that you can override in other languages/platforms, but you can tie in anywhere you can imagine for the most part. It's especially nice getting to do that when the element might not exist yet.

## HW 5

 I learned that I actually don't need jQuery for AJAX... **_Who knew?_**

 Really though, I was able to see the benefits of using vanilla js to make requests and customize error and data handling myself. Otherwise, I'd have to figure out how jQuery handled the specific errors I might be looking for to try and adjust to it. I also wouldn't have been able to pass in a callback functin to handle the errors and enjoy the beauty of modularity with functions.

 I did also start to see the value of callback functions to help customize code execution more dynamically than I'd thought of before. Javascript does have some real beauty beneath it's quirky exterior.
