# HW 5 Learnings

 I learned that I actually don't need jQuery for AJAX... **_Who knew?_**

 Really though, I was able to see the benefits of using vanilla js to make requests and customize error and data handling myself. Otherwise, I'd have to figure out how jQuery handled the specific errors I might be looking for to try and adjust to it. I also wouldn't have been able to pass in a callback function to handle the errors and enjoy the beauty of modularity with functions.

 I did also start to see the value of callback functions to help customize code execution more dynamically than I'd thought of before. Javascript does have some real beauty beneath it's quirky exterior.
